# Abstract
The rapid increase of smoking-related diseases and deaths globally is driving us to find an effective approach
to reduce the smoking rate. This study aims to determine whether indoor smoking bans at workplaces can
effectively reduce the smoking rate. The “Smokeban” dataset used for this study is an observational dataset
that contains some socio-demographic factors, whether people smoke, and whether smoking bans exist. Since
the observational data used in the study did not randomize people into “with smoking bans” group and
“without smoking bans” group, confounders may cause bias in the estimation of whether the smoking bans
can reduce smoking rates. The propensity score matching (PSM) method can reduce these biases via using a
logistic regression model to predict the similarities of people in those 2 groups and using the nearest neighbor
matching technique to match people who are the most similar. After reducing the bias, another regression
model was created to interpret the relationship between the probability of smoking and the indoor smoking
bans. We conclude by arguing that with the existence of indoor smoking bans, the probability of people who
smoke can be decreased greatly.
